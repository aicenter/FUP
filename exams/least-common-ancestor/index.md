# Least Common Ancestor

Suppose we have a binary tree $t$. For any two nodes $x,y$ in the tree $t$, the *least common
ancestor* of $x$ and $y$ is defined as the node $z$ satisfying the following two conditions:

1. $x$ and $y$ are descendants of $z$,
2. if there is a node $z'$ having $x$ and $y$ as descendants, then $z$ is descendant of $z'$.

To find the least common ancestor of two nodes $x$ and $y$ in a tree $t$, we follow the steps below:

1. find the path $p_x$ from the root $r$ of $t$ to $x$ (i.e., a list of nodes starting in $r$ and
   ending in $x$), 
2. find the path $p_y$ from $r$ to $y$,
3. consider the common prefix of $p_x$ and $p_y$, the last node in the common prefix is the least
   common ancestor. 

Consider, for example, the binary tree depicted below. The least common ancestor 
of $3$ and $5$ is $2$. Indeed, the path from the root $1$ to $3$ is $1,2,3$. The path from $1$
to $5$ is $1,2,4,5$. Their common prefix is $1,2$ whose last element is $2$.

Similarly, the least common ancestor of $5$ and $8$ is $1$. The least common ancestor of 
$7$ and $7$ is $7$.

## Racket

In Racket, implement a function `(common-ancestor x y tree)` that takes 
two nodes `x`, `y` and a binary tree `tree`, and returns the least common-ancestor
of `x` and `y` in `tree`. If `x` or `y` does not belong to `tree`,
the function returns \Verb|#f|.

To represent binary trees in Racket, use the following structures:
```scheme
(struct node (val left right) #:transparent)
(struct leaf (val) #:transparent)
```
Thus the leaves (nodes without children) are represented as, for instance, `(leaf 6)`.
The nodes with children are represented as, for instance, `(node 1 (leaf 2) (leaf 3))`.

To implement the function `common-ancestor`, implement first a function 
`(find-path x tree)` that finds a path from the root of `tree` to `x`. 
For example,
```scheme
(define tree (node 1 (node 2 (leaf 5) (leaf 6))
                     (node 3 (leaf 4) (leaf 7))))

> (find-path 7 tree)
'(1 3 7) 
```

Your file should be called `ancestor.rkt` and should export the `find-path` and 
`common-ancestor` functions and the structures `node` and `leaf`.
```scheme
#lang racket

(provide find-path
         common-ancestor
         (struct-out node)
         (struct-out leaf))

(struct node (val kids) #:transparent)
(struct leaf (val) #:transparent)

(define (find-path x tree)
  ; Implement me!
  )

(define (common-ancestor x y tree)
  ; Implement me!
  )
```

### Example

```scheme
(define tree2 (node 1 (node 2 (leaf 3)
                              (node 4 (leaf 5)
                                      (leaf 6)))
                      (node 7 (leaf 8)
                              (leaf 9))))

> (common-ancestor 3 5 tree2)
2

> (common-ancestor 3 15 tree2)
#f
```

### Hints

To find the common prefix of two lists, use the function `(take-common-prefix lst1 lst2)`.

                      (list x)

## Haskell

Implement a function `commonAncestor :: Eq a => a -> a -> Tree a -> Maybe a` that takes two nodes
and a binary tree, and returns the least common ancestor of these two nodes.  If it does not exist,
the function returns `Nothing`.

To represent binary trees in Haskell, use the following data type:
```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf a
            | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Eq,Show)  
```
Thus the leaves (nodes without children) are represented as, for instance, `Leaf 6`.
The nodes with children are represented as, for instance,
`Node 1 (Leaf 2) (Leaf 3)`.

To implement the function `commonAncestor`, implement first a function\\ 
`findPath :: Eq a => a -> Tree a -> [a]` that finds for a given node and a binary tree
the path from the root to that node. For example,
```haskell
tree = Node 1 (Node 2 (Leaf 5) (Leaf 6)) (Node 3 (Leaf 4) (Leaf 7))

> findPath 7 tree
[1,3,7]
```

Your file should be called `Ancestor.hs` and should export the `commonAncestor`, 
`findPath` functions and the type `Tree`.

```haskell
module Ancestor (findPath, commonAncestor, Tree(..)) where

data Tree a = Leaf a
            | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Eq,Show)

findPath :: Eq a => a -> Tree a -> [a]
-- implement me!

commonAncestor :: Eq a => a -> a -> Tree a -> Maybe a
-- implement me!
```

### Example

```haskell
tree2 = Node 1 (Node 2 (Leaf 3)
                       (Node 4 (Leaf 5)
                               (Leaf 6)))
               (Node 7 (Leaf 8)
                       (Leaf 9))

> commonAncestor 3 5 tree2
Just 2

> commonAncestor 3 15 tree2
Nothing
```

```haskell
module Task4 (findPath, commonAncestor, Tree(..)) where

data Tree a = Leaf a
            | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Eq,Show)

tree2 = Node 1 (Node 2 (Leaf 3)
                       (Node 4 (Leaf 5)
                               (Leaf 6)))
               (Node 7 (Leaf 8)
                       (Leaf 9))

findPath :: Eq a => a -> Tree a -> [a]
findPath x (Leaf y) | x == y = [x]
                    | otherwise = []
findPath x (Node y l r) | x == y = [x]

                                         else y:(pl++pr)

commonAncestor :: Eq a => a -> a -> Tree a -> Maybe a
commonAncestor x y t | null common = Nothing 
                     | otherwise = Just $ last common 
    where px = findPath x t
          py = findPath y t
          common = [x | (x,y) <- zip px py, x==y ]
