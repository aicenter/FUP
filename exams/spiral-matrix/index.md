# Spiral Matrix

A *Spiral Matrix* is a square $n\times n$-matrix filled with natural numbers, 
starting from $1$ in the top-left corner, increasing in inward, clockwise spiral order, like these examples:
$$
\mathbf{S}_3=\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
  1 & 2 & 3\\
  8 & 9 & 4\\
  7 & 6 & 5
\end{array}\right)
\qquad
\mathbf{S}_5=\left(\begin{array}{rrrrr}
  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
  16 & 17 & 18 &19 & 6\\
  15 & 24 & 25 & 20 & 7\\
  14 & 23 & 22 & 21 & 8\\
  13 & 12 & 11 & 10 & 9
\end{array}\right)
$$

Even though one can define a spiral matrix for each size $n$, your task is to implement a function generating
a spiral $n\times n$-matrix only for odd $n$. Note that such matrices can be generated recursively because 
the spiral matrix $\mathbf{S}_n$ of size $n\times n$ can be constructed from the spiral matrix $\mathbf{S}_{n-2}$
of size $(n-2)\times(n-2)$ as follows:

$$
\mathbf{S}_n=\left(
  \begin{array}{rrrrr}
    1 & 2 & \cdots & n-1 & n \\
    4n-4 &  &  &  & n+1 \\
    \vdots & &\mathbf{B} & &\vdots \\
    3n-1 &  &  &   & 2n-2\\
    3n-2 & 3n-3 & \cdots & 2n & 2n-1
  \end{array}
\right)  
$$
where $\mathbf{B}$ is basically the matrix $\mathbf{S}_{n-2}$ whose all elements are increased by $4n-4$.

## Racket

In Racket, implement a function `(spiral-matrix n)` that accepts a positive odd integer
and returns the spiral matrix $\mathbf{S}_n$ of size `n`. 
A matrix is represented as a list of its rows, e.g. $\mathbf{S}_3$ is represented as
```scheme
'((1 2 3)
  (8 9 4)
  (7 6 5))
```

Your file is to be called `spiral-matrix.rkt` and must provide the function `spiral-matrix`.
Hence, the head of your file should start with
```scheme
#lang racket
(provide spiral-matrix)

; your code here
```

### Hint
To generate a sequences of numbers, you may use the function `(range start end step)` generating
a sequence of numbers starting at `start` and whose successive elements are computed by adding 
`step` until `end`. Note that the element `end` is excluded. E.g. 
```scheme
> (range 5 0 -1)
'(5 4 3 2 1)
```

### Examples
The following shows the behaviour of the `spiral-matrix` function.

```scheme
> (spiral-matrix 3)
'((1 2 3)
  (8 9 4)
  (7 6 5))
```

```scheme
> (spiral-matrix 1)
'((1))
```

::: details Racket Solution
```scheme
#lang racket

(provide spiral-matrix)


(define (mat-add xss n)
	(map (curry map (curry + n)) xss))


(define (wrap x ys z)
  (cons x (append ys (list z))))


(define (spiral-matrix n)
  (define (extendH x)
    (map wrap
         (range (- (* 4 n) 4) (- (* 3 n) 2) -1)
         x
         (range (+ n 1) (- (* 2 n) 1))))

  (define (extendV x)
    (wrap (range 1 (+ 1 n))
          x
          (range (- (* 3 n) 2) (- (* 2 n) 2) -1)))

  (if (equal? 1 n)
    '((1))
    (let ((smaller (spiral-matrix (- n 2))))
	(extendV (extendH (mat-add smaller (- (* 4 n) 4)))))))
```

## Haskell

In Haskell, implement a function `spiralMatrix :: Int -> Matrix` that accepts a positive odd integer
$n$ and returns the spiral matrix $\mathbf{S}_n$ of size $n$. 
A matrix is represented as a list of its rows by data type 
`type Matrix = [[Int]]`, e.g. $\mathbf{S}_3$ is represented as
```scheme
[[1, 2, 3]
,[8, 9, 4]
,[7, 6, 5]]
```


Your task is to be called `SpiralMatrix.rkt` and must export the `spiralMatrix` 
function.
Hence, the head of your file should read

```haskell
module SpiralMatrix ( spiralMatrix ) where
type Matrix = [[Int]]

-- your code goes here
```

### Hint
You may find the function `zipWith3 f xs ys zs` useful which processes three lists 
`xs`, `ys`, `zs` simultaneously applying the ternary function `f` to 
the triples of corresponding elements, e.g.,
```haskell
> zipWith3 (\c1 c2 c3 -> [c1,c2,c3]) "abcd" "blaa" "haha"
["abh","bla","cah","daa"]  
```

Generating a sequence of numbers in Haskell can be done by `[start,start+step..end]`, e.g.,
```haskell
> [5,4..1]
[5,4,3,2,1]    
```
In comparison with the Scheme function `range`, the final number `end` is included
in the generated sequence.

### Examples
The following shows the behaviour of the `spiralMatrix` function.

```haskell
> spiralMatrix 3
[[1,2,3]
,[8,9,4]
,[7,6,5]]
```

```haskell
> spiralMatrix 1
[[1]]
```

::: details Haskell Solution
```haskell
module Task4 ( spiralMatrix ) where
type Matrix = [[Int]]

matAdd xss n = (map . map) (+ n) xss

wrap x ys z = x:ys++[z]

spiralMatrix 1 = [[1]]
spiralMatrix n = extendV $ extendH $ matAdd smaller (4*n-4) where
        smaller = spiralMatrix (n - 2)
        extendH x = zipWith3 wrap [4*n-4,4*n-5..3*n-1] x [n+1..2*n-2]
        extendV x = wrap [1..n] x [3*n-2,3*n-3..2*n-1]
```
