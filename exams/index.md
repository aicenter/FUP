# Exam

The final exam consists of The *programming* part, followed by an optional *oral* exam:

- **30 points:** In the *programming* exam, you will have 3 hours to solve one Racket assignment (15 points) and one Haskell assignment (15 points). You have to reach at least 16 points in total to pass the programming exam. You will have access to all course materials on this webpage, as well as the Racket documentation and Hoogle, but you will not have access to the internet.
- **20 points:** You can take an optional 15-minute *oral exam* after you pass the programming exam. We will ask you about the theoretical underpinnings of functional programming, Racket, and Haskell. You can earn up to 20 extra points, and you cannot lose any points.

To be eligible for the exam, your homework solutions must meet at least the [minimum requirements](/homework/#requirements).

The programming exam will consist of solving two of the tasks listed on this webpage - without access to their solutions. We suggest not looking at the text of the assignments before you have time to attempt to solve it. Most of the tasks have a Racket and a Haskell version. During the exam you have to solve *one task in one language* and another task in another language. So an exam could look like:

- Solve [$N^2$-Knights](/exams/minesweeper/) in Racket (for 15 points)
- Solve [Filetree](/exams/filetree/) in Haskell (for 15 points)

You will have 3 hours for the whole exam, so you should be able to solve each of them in roughly 90
minutes to get a perfect score.

You will upload your exam solutions to BRUTE like you are used to from the homework, and get
immediate feedback on how many points you achieved. You can upload your solution as many times as
you want.

The exam dates for 2025 are not decided yet.
