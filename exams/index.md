# Exam

- To be admitted to the exam, you should have to fulfill the conditions for passing the
[homework requirements](/homework/#requirements).

- The [_**programming exam**_](#programming-exam-details):
    - You have to solve *one Racket assignment* (15 points) and *one Haskell assignment* (15
      points), which you have to finish in 3 hours.
    - You have to reach at least **16 points** in the programming exam *to pass the exam*.
    - You have access to *all course materials* on this webpage, to the racket documentation, to
      Hoogle, but of course no internet.

- The (optional) _**oral exam**_:
    - You can take this part of the exam *only if you passed the programming exam*.
    - Approximately 15 minuates. No materials. Just pen and paper.
    - We will ask you about the theoretical underpinnings of functional programming, Racket, and
      Haskell.
    - You can earn an extra **20 points**, but *you cannot loose any points* not matter what you say
      in this part of the exam.


### Programming exam details

The programming exam will consist of solving two of the tasks listed on this webpage - without access to their solutions. We suggest not looking at the text of the assignments before you have time to attempt to solve it. Most of the tasks have a Racket and a Haskell version. During the exam you have to solve *one task in one language* and another task in another language. So an exam could look like:

- Solve [$N^2$-Knights](/exams/minesweeper/) in Racket (for 15 points)
- Solve [Filetree](/exams/filetree/) in Haskell (for 15 points)

You will have 3 hours for the whole exam, so you should be able to solve each of them in roughly 90
minutes to get a perfect score.

You will upload your exam solutions to BRUTE like you are used to from the homework, and get
immediate feedback on how many points you achieved. You can upload your solution as many times as
you want.

We offer the following exam dates for the summer semester of 2024:
