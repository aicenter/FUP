# Labs

The labs usually consist of two parts. In the first part, the teacher introduces new concepts from
the last lecture and shows students how to use them. In the second part, students are given tasks
that they try to solve individually.

The solutions to the given tasks will be available after the last lecture of the week.

## Racket

| # | Title | Content |
|-|-|-|
| 1. | [Introduction](lab01) | In this lab you will familiarize yourself with the IDE we will use to write Racket  programs. |
| 2. | [Lists & Trees](lab02) | The main purpose of this lab is to practice elementary recursive manipulation with lists |
| 3. | [Higher Order Functions](lab03) | Deals with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `foldl`. |
