# Lectures

As we proceed through the lectures, I will try to write down lecture notes so that you have most of
the course material in a single place. However, I am unsure if I will manage to be on time with them
due to other obligations.

## [Lecture 01](lecture01): Introduction
Discusses the key ideas behind functional programming. It further
introduces the programming language [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

[Slides](https://github.com/aicenter/FUP/blob/main/lectures/lecture01.pdf).
[Log](https://github.com/aicenter/FUP/blob/main/lectures/lecture01.rkt).

## [Lecture 02](lecture02): Lists & Trees
Focuses on Racket lists and trees. Further, it introduces the unit testing library
[Rackunit](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/index.html).

[Slides](https://github.com/aicenter/FUP/blob/main/lectures/lecture02.pdf).
[Log](https://github.com/aicenter/FUP/blob/main/lectures/lecture02.rkt).

## [Lecture 3](lecture03): Higher Order Functions
Deals with higher-order functions like (`map`, `filter`, `foldl`), function closures and Racket
structures.

## [Lecture 4](lecture04)
Introduces pattern matching, and explains how to implement lazy evaluation and streams in Racket.

<!--
5. [Lecture 5](lecture05) briefly introduces syntactic macros, and shows how to implement
   interpreters (the latter is remains to be written).

6. [Lecture 6](lecture06) introduces lambda calculus.

For the interested read there is a [bonus lecture](lecture-bonus) on immutable datastructures.
