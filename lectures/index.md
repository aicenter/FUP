This is a collection of my lecture notes on functional programming. 
It is based on the content of the introductory course *Functional Programming* I lecture at 
[Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz).
The course introduces two programming languages, namely 
and 
One lecture focuses on lambda calculus.

# Lecture notes

1. [Lecture 1](lecture01) discusses the key ideas behind functional programming. It further
   introduces the programming language [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

2. [Lecture 2](lecture02) focuses on Racket lists and trees. Further, it introduces the unit testing
   library [Rackunit](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/index.html).

3. [Lecture 3](lecture03) deals with higher-order functions, function closures and Racket structures.

4. [Lecture 4](lecture04) introduces pattern matching, and explains how to implement lazy
   evaluation and streams in Racket.

5. [Lecture 5](lecture05) briefly introduces syntactic macros, and shows how to implement
   interpreters (the latter is remains to be written).

6. [Lecture 6](lecture06) introduces lambda calculus.

For the interested read there is a [bonus lecture](lecture-bonus) on immutable datastructures.
