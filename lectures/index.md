# Lectures

As we proceed through the lectures, I will try to write down lecture notes so that you have most of
the course material in a single place. However, I am unsure if I will manage to be on time with them
due to other obligations.

## [Lecture 01](lecture01): Introduction
Discusses the key ideas behind functional programming. It further
introduces the programming language [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e1aw5Mf5qts0DxLJFDZUWDbGlwI0hdeM/view?usp=drive_link).
[Log](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I3uoTART5UmWsWLRR_bYuNrzolTl2cO5/view?usp=share_link).

## [Lecture 02](lecture02): Lists & Trees
Focuses on Racket lists and trees. Further, it introduces the unit testing library
[Rackunit](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/index.html).

3. [Lecture 3](lecture03) deals with higher-order functions, function closures and Racket structures.

4. [Lecture 4](lecture04) introduces pattern matching, and explains how to implement lazy
   evaluation and streams in Racket.

5. [Lecture 5](lecture05) briefly introduces syntactic macros, and shows how to implement
   interpreters (the latter is remains to be written).

6. [Lecture 6](lecture06) introduces lambda calculus.

For the interested read there is a [bonus lecture](lecture-bonus) on immutable datastructures.
