This course introduces students to the techniques of **functional programming**, the advantages and
disadvantages of this programming paradigm, and its use in practice. This approach is
**declarative** in the sense that the programmer symbolically describes the problem to be solved
rather than specifying the exact sequence of operations required to solve it. It allows focusing on
the essence of the solved problem and implementing even more complex algorithms compactly.
Functional programming has notable advantages for **parallelization** and **automated verification**
of algorithms, and the most useful functional programming concepts are increasingly often introduced
to standard programming languages. Because of the focus of functional programming on symbols rather
than numbers, functional programming has been heavily used in artificial intelligence fields, such
as agent systems or symbolic machine learning.
