This course introduces students to the techniques of functional programming, the advantages and
disadvantages of this programming paradigm, and its use in practice. This approach is declarative in
the sense that the programmer	symbolically describes the problem to be solved rather than
specifying the exact sequence of operations required to solve it. It allows focusing on the essence
of the solved problem and implementing even more complex algorithms compactly. Functional
programming has notable advantages for parallelization and automated verification of algorithms, and
the most useful functional programming concepts are increasingly often introduced to standard
programming languages. Because of the focus of functional programming on symbols rather than
numbers, functional programming has been heavily used in artificial intelligence fields, such as
agent systems or symbolic machine learning.

## Organization

Weekly [lectures](lectures/) and [labs](labs/).

Homework assignments **50 points**
* 2 assignments in Racket
* 2 assignments in Haskell

Final programming exam for **30 points**.
The programming exam consists of 2 Racket assignments and 2 Haskell assignments, which you have to finish in 3 hours.
One Racket and one Haskell assignment are actually the same but implemented in both programming languages.

Final theoretical oral exam for **20 points**.

The grading is the standard one, i.e.,
|Grade| Points|
|-|-|
|A|91-100|
|B|81-90|
|C|71-80|
|D|61-70|
|E|51-60|
|F|0-50|

## Exams

In order to come to the exam, the student should have fulfilled the conditions for passing the labs.

::: danger Important
Please make sure you know your lab password. You can [change it here](https://www.felk.cvut.cz/labpass/)
:::

The exam will consist of solving two of the tasks that are published
[here](https://xhorcik.gitlab.io/fup-lecture-notes/#exam) - without access to their solutions. We
suggest not looking at the text of the assignments before you have time to attempt to solve it. You
should be able to solve each of them in roughly 90 minutes to get a perfect score in the exam.
