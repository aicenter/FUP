# Organization

This course introduces students to the techniques of _**functional programming**_, the advantages
and disadvantages of this programming paradigm, and its use in practice.
This approach is **declarative** in the sense that the programmer symbolically describes the problem to be solved
rather than specifying the exact sequence of operations required to solve it. It allows focusing on
the essence of the solved problem and implementing even more complex algorithms compactly.
Functional programming has notable advantages for **parallelization** and **automated verification**
of algorithms, and the most useful functional programming concepts are increasingly often introduced
to standard programming languages. Because of the focus of functional programming on symbols rather
than numbers, functional programming has been heavily used in artificial intelligence fields, such
as agent systems or symbolic machine learning.

The course consists of weekly [lectures](lectures/) and [labs](labs/) which will be published
as we go along the course.

## Course Outline

This course explores:

* **Racket** which features a simple syntax that aligns with λ-calculus, is dynamically typed, supports mutable data, and can treat code as data, which makes it easy to write interpreters;
* **$\lambda$-calculus** as the theoretical foundation of functional programming;
* and **Haskell** a pure functional language with static typing, a rich type system, and a design that strictly separates its pure core from its mutable shell.

## Grading
You will receive points for solving [Homework Assignments](/homework/) and the final [Practical and Oral Exams](/exams/).

## Where to get Help

If you struggle with an exercise or an assignment, feel free to contact your tutor via email. For questions which could help others, we recommend posting in the course [discussion forum](https://cw.felk.cvut.cz/forum/forum-1867.html), where we will prioritize responses. There are also online communities where you can get in touch with your peers:
* The [Faculty Discord](https://discord.gg/cvutfel) is primarily in Czech. You can select which course's channels you want to see in `#volba-předmětů` (check `#fup`) after authenticating with a faculty account.
* The [Functional Programming Discord](https://discord.gg/7C3RPWZcYg) is primarily in English, and includes channels not only for Racket (`#racket`) and Haskell (`#haskell-beginners`, `#haskell-beginners-more`, `#haskell`, `#haskell-tooling`), but also for all kinds of FP and math topics.
