# Organization

This course introduces students to the techniques of _**functional programming**_, exploring their advantages, and practical applications. Functional programming takes a **declarative** approach, where the programmer describes the problem  symbolically rather than through explicit step-by-step instructions. This paradigm focuses on the essence of problems, and enables compact implementations of complex algorithms. Functional programming has notable advantages for **parallelization** and **automated verification** of algorithms. Useful functional programming concepts are increasingly often introduced to standard programming languages. Due to its symbolic nature, functional programming has been heavily used in artificial intelligence, particularly in agent systems and symbolic machine learning.

The course consists of weekly [lectures](lectures/) and [labs](labs/).

## Course Outline

This course explores:

* **Racket** which features a simple syntax that aligns with λ-calculus, is dynamically typed, supports mutable data, and can treat code as data, which makes it easy to write interpreters;
* **$\lambda$-calculus** as the theoretical foundation of functional programming;
* and **Haskell** a pure functional language with static typing, a rich type system, and a design that strictly separates its pure core from its mutable shell.

## Grading
You will receive points for solving [Homework Assignments](/homework/) and the final [Practical and Oral Exams](/exams/).

## Where to get Help

If you struggle with an exercise or an assignment, feel free to contact your tutor via email. For questions which could help others, we recommend posting in the course [discussion forum](https://cw.felk.cvut.cz/forum/forum-1912.html), where we will prioritize responses. There are also online communities where you can get in touch with your peers:
* The [Faculty Discord](https://discord.gg/cvutfel) is primarily in Czech. You can select which course's channels you want to see in `#volba-předmětů` (check `#fup`) after authenticating with a faculty account.
* The [Functional Programming Discord](https://discord.gg/7C3RPWZcYg) is primarily in English, and includes channels not only for Racket (`#racket`) and Haskell (`#haskell-beginners`, `#haskell-beginners-more`, `#haskell`, `#haskell-tooling`), but also for all kinds of FP and math topics.
